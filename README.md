==============

This application is intended to be used to visualize results and data of rigid body dynamics systems. It is build on top of [RBDL](https://github.com/ORB-HD/rbdl-orb) and uses Qt3D as it's graphics backend. RBDL-Toolkit is designed to be extendable via plugins and to make developing plugins easy there is a [plugin template](https://github.com/ORB-HD/toolkit-plugin-template). 

RBDL-Toolkit now supports loading and displaying of Lua and URDF models!
